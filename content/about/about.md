# Hello!

I am a **computer enthusiast** with a passion for **low-level programming**, focusing on understanding the inner workings of computer systems and software. Over the years, my curiosity has led me to dive deep into **operating system concepts**, **Linux**, and the world of **systems programming**.

## My Skills & Interests

- **Beginner in C programming**: Currently strengthening my understanding of low-level concepts through C.
- **Interested in Rust and Golang**: Planning to learn these languages to expand my knowledge and build efficient, modern systems.
- **Systems Programming**: Fascinated by how software interacts with hardware and how systems operate at their core.
- **Optimization & Performance**: Passionate about writing code that is not only functional but also efficient.

## My Journey

I have been a **long-time Linux user**, and through this experience, I’ve developed a strong interest in how operating systems work from the ground up. I strive to understand the complexities of **memory management**, **hardware interaction**, and **system security**.

### Career Goals

My ultimate goal is to create **efficient system software** that powers modern computing systems. I aim to work on low-level projects that require deep technical knowledge and offer the opportunity to contribute to the **open-source community**.

- **Building efficient software**: I want to contribute to creating software that is both performant and reliable.
- **Open-source contributions**: I’m eager to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with others in the community.

## Community Involvement

In addition to my technical interests, I am actively involved in the **Free Software and Open Source** community. I serve as an **event coordinator** for the **Özgür Yazılım ve Açık Kaynak topluluğu** (Free Software and Open Source Community). In this role, I organize events, workshops, and discussions to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the growth of the open-source ecosystem.

## Let's Connect!

I’m always open to meeting like-minded individuals who share an interest in **Linux**, **systems programming**, and **open-source software**. If you'd like to collaborate on projects, share knowledge, or simply discuss technology, feel free to reach out!
