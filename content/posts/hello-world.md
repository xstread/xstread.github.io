# Hello World!

Welcome to my world of **low-level programming**, **Linux**, and **system software**!

## A Recent Switch to Fedora

After using **Arch Linux** for quite some time, I made the switch to **Fedora** after the release of **Fedora 41**. I wanted a stable yet cutting-edge distribution that aligned with my needs for a more streamlined Linux experience. 

- **Why Fedora?** I appreciated Fedora's focus on **open-source** software and its cutting-edge approach with a more stable release cycle compared to Arch.
  
## My Desktop Environment: KDE + Tiling

On my new setup, I'm running **KDE Plasma** with **tiling**, which is an important change for me. I enjoy the sleek look and flexibility of KDE, but I'm still adjusting to the tiling functionality. Specifically, I'm not entirely happy with **KWin's tiling script (Krohnkite)**. It works well, but it’s not as smooth and seamless as I’d like.

### What I Wish for in KDE

I really hope that **KDE** will introduce a **native auto-tiling feature** in the future, making tiling more intuitive and seamless out of the box. The current experience with third-party scripts is functional but not ideal for a smooth workflow. 

## A Desire for Simplicity

Once I switch to my laptop, I don't want to deal with window managers anymore. I’m seeking an experience where I don’t have to constantly tweak things. A simple and efficient tiling experience would be ideal, and I’d like KDE to support that natively without needing external scripts or configurations.

## Why This Matters to Me

While I focus heavily on low-level development and system software, my **workspace environment** plays an important role in my productivity. A clean, efficient, and enjoyable desktop environment helps me stay focused on what truly matters — writing code and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.
